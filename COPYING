Apparently not defining and providing a copyright does not defeat the fact
that a default copyright is globally assumed and implied, which allows others to
read the source code, but they have no legal right to use or modify it.  This
is NOT the intention of this project by any stretch.  The entire purpose of
publishing the our source code is in the hopes that it may be found useful, to
students, teachers, hobbyists, and professionals.  All source code is intended
to be made available without restriction to be used for learning purposes,
and/or to be used in full or in part in both open and closed source
applications.

The license agreement we've chosen to associate with this project is the
WTF Public License (WTFPL), as it very clearly conveys the restrictions
(or lack thereof) placed upon the use of the software/source code provided
in this project.  Despite its unfortunate and offensive name, this license is
approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and is fully GNU GPL compatible.

Again, apologies to those who may be offended by Sam Hocevar's naming choice
of this license agreement.

    See http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl for more details.
